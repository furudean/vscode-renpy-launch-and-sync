# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Fix a crash when warping or following the cursor in a file that isn't inside a Ren'Py project
- Fix a crash when linting a project with no SDK path set

## 3.5.0 - 2026-03-18

- Add "Force Recompile" command (`renpyWarp.forceRecompile`) to recompile all `.rpy` scripts
- Write workspace projects to `projects.txt` in the Ren'Py SDK directory before opening the launcher, so they appear alongside existing projects
- Optimization pass

## 3.4.0 - 2026-03-05

- Set `RENPY_SCREENSHOT_PATTERN` on launched processes if not overwritten by any other environment

## 3.3.2 - 2026-02-23

fix a bug relating to version strings

## 3.3.1 - 2026-02-23

whoops i broke it! but its fine now!

## 3.3.0 - 2026-02-23

- You can now download nightly versions in the SDK downloader
- Revise back button to SDK download when opened from SDK selector
- Fix certain nightly version strings not being correctly parsed

## 3.2.2 - 2026-02-20

- Fix favorite saving not working
- Fix unfavorited items showing wrong icon

## 3.2.1 - 2026-02-20

Windows build failed due to lint failures, so this is an attempt to release it again. This patch contains no changes -- See changelog for 3.2.0.

## 3.2.0 - 2026-02-20

- You can now favorite labels in the `renpyWarp.jumpToLabel` ([#108](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/108))
- The _Quit Ren'Py_ button now closes the window without asking for confirmation in Ren'Py. This is achieved by overwriting `config.quit_action` when a session is active.
- Remove error message when initial socket connection cannot be made, and instead notify the user when waiting for a connection to be established ([#109](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/109))
- Remove error message when game crashes (you already know that it crashed...) ([#109](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/109))
- Improve how versions are rendered in status bar
- There is now a way to return from the "Download SDK" menu
- Properly clean up `renpy.config.quit_callbacks` when connection closes in RPE
- Remove the unused `renpyWarp.sdksDirectories` setting
- Adds a `renpyWarp.resetWorkspaceState` command, which removes any workspace-level persistent data saved by the extension
- Bump packages

## 3.1.0 - 2026-01-29

- Don't show the picker again after SDK version is installed
- Update documentation in `vscode_renpy_warp.rpe.py`
- Adjust some text strings in the SDK downloader
- If game starts or ends, reset the decoration

## 3.0.0 - 2026-01-02

- **Remove `focusWindowOnWarp` feature.** This feature relied on the
  dependency `node-window-manager` which is unmaintained and has stopped
  working on my system due to
  [a bug which has not been fixed](https://github.com/sentialx/node-window-manager/issues/68).
  It was also a very technically complicated solution that I was never happy
  with.
- SDK downloads now determine what is the current version by utilizing the
  [/channels.json](https://www.renpy.org/channels.json) endpoint.
- RPE name pattern changed from `renpy_warp_*.rpe.py` to
  `vscode_renpy_warp_*.rpe.py` for additional clarity.
- Bump dependencies

## 2.1.2 - 2025-05-06

- Try to fix broken windows build

## 2.1.1 - 2025-05-06

- Last version had improper version tag

## 2.1.0 - 2025-05-06

- Validate checksums of downloaded SDKs
- Log errors when status bar item cannot be created

## 2.0.3 - 2025-05-05

- Somehow I got this wrong three times. But it should work now.

## 2.0.2 - 2025-05-05

- Fix assets handling (again)

## 2.0.1 - 2025-05-05

- Fix icon font not being copied to the built extension

## 2.0.0 - 2025-05-05

- **Breaking**: Minimum supported Visual Studio Code version is now 1.101.0.
- **Breaking**: RPEs will no longer proactively be installed on extension
  launch. Instead, they will be installed when a game is launched or a command
  is explicitly called to install them. If you only start games externally,
  you will need to call the command `renpyWarp.installRPE` manually to first
  install the RPE. Updates are still handled automatically.
- **Breaking**: RPEs in the SDK root are no longer monitored. This feature has
  been unused for some time, and the only code remaining was to find any that
  still existed in the SDK root.
- SDKs can now be downloaded and managed directly inside Visual Studio Code,
  using the command `renpyWarp.downloadSdk`. The SDK picker has been updated
  to guide users through this feature.
- A status bar item has been added to aid with discovery on this feature (and
  to highlight the used Ren'Py version).
- SDKs are now configured on a per-workspace basis when using the UI. If you
  want to set the SDK path for all workspaces, you can still do so by setting
  the `renpyWarp.sdkPath` setting in your user settings.
- On Ren'Py 8.4.0 and higher, RPEs are now installed in `game/libs/`.
- A setting to ignore file patterns, `renpyWarp.exclude` has been introduced.
  This setting is used to exclude files from being watched or processed by the
  extension.
- Searching for RPEs has been optimized, now doing less redundant processing
  than before.
- Update dependencies to the latest versions

## 1.35.0 - 2025-05-03

- Adds two new commands, `renpyWarp.lint` and `renpyWarp.rmpersistent`, which
  allow you to run the Ren'Py linter and delete persistent data respectively
  ([#87](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/87))
- Some older versions of Ren'Py, ~7.4 are now supported
- Fix a bug where the extension would be stuck in a 'starting' state if you
  cancel out of the extensions preference prompt
- Removes incorrect 'install in SDK' prompt
- Bump dependencies

## 1.34.0 - 2025-03-11

- Better align the current line decoration to text
- Adds a new command, `renpyWarp.launchSDK` which can be triggered to open the
  launcher for the configured Ren'Py SDK
- Renames "Start Ren'Py project" to "Launch Ren'Py project"
- Status bar text now says "Launch Ren'Py Project"

## 1.33.0 - 2024-12-16

- Show the current label in label picker menu

## 1.30.0 - 2024-12-04

- Now uses `config.display_start_callbacks` in place of `game.post_init` to
  run RPE on a game render, but not build
- Relax needlessly strict command enablements
- Use `TextEditorRevealType.InCenterIfOutsideViewport` when following cursor
- Sync editor when `renpyWarp.toggleFollowCursor`, if possible

## 1.29.0 + 1.29.1 - 2024-11-27

- Correct handling of RPE install/uninstall when multiple `game` folders are
  present in a workspace. The previous behavior would only install/uninstall
  the RPE in the first `game` folder found and deleted all others

## 1.28.0 - 2024-11-24

- `renpyWarp.setSdkPath` utilizes the vscode file picker instead of asking for
  a string for the SDK path

## 1.27.2 - 2024-11-24

- `renpyWarp.syncCursorPosition` will now reveal the cursor even if the
  position has not changed

## 1.27.1 - 2024-11-24

  disconnected with the server
- Fix broken RPE event loop
- Handle unmanaged processes that have already been approveda

- Prompt when external Ren'Py process is detected to ask if the user wants to
  use the extension with it
- Jump to label now ignores focus out on the quick pick
- Change the order of checks to ignore games not associated with the current
  workspace

## 1.20.0 - 2024-09-03

- Overhaul logging system to use `logging.getLogger` instead of `print`
- The logging level can be set with the environment variable `WARP_LOGLEVEL`

  path is not set
- Should now properly support Ren'Py versions 7 and lower on Windows, with the
  caveat that RPE features will not be available
- SDK path detection now relies on a more simple method, which should be more
  reliable

## 1.18.1 - 2024-08-18

- Fix a bug where jump to label would be disabled when it shouldn't be

## 1.18.0 - 2024-08-18

- Handle "misbehaving" Ren'Py processes
- `renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp` now affects jumping to labels
- Utilize enablements to hide some commands that are invalid in certain
  contexts ([#47](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/47))

## 1.17.1 - 2024-08-18

- Accidentally shipped some bad code in the RPE file. This has been fixed.

## 1.17.0 - 2024-08-18

  label in your Ren'Py project

## 1.16.0 - 2024-08-18

  responsive
- Properly clean up file descriptors when launching a Ren'Py process

## 1.15.0 - 2024-08-17

- Add option to hide some notifications, which can be reset with the command
  `renpyWarp.resetSuppressedMessages`

## 1.14.1 - 2024-08-12

- Fix handling of RPE metadata in 8.2, which made the socket server not
  connect
- Resolve symlinked paths when discovering an external Ren'Py process

## 1.14.0 - 2024-08-12

- External Ren'Py processes can now be picked up by the extension, allowing
  you to work with Ren'Py projects that are not opened through Visual Studio
  Code.
- Renpy Extensions will not be updated on extension activation (if enabled)
  instead of only on launch. This is to facilitate the above use case.
- The socket server now starts when the extension is activated, rather than
  when a game is launched. This is configurable via the new setting
  `renpyWarp.autoStartSocketServer`
- The commands `renpyWarp.startSocketServer` and `renpyWarp.stopSocketServer`
  have been added to manually start and stop the socket server respectively
- `renpyWarp.socketPorts` has been removed, now using a static list of ports
- Fix auto save feature not working if `renpy` was not a registered language.
  Now simply checks if the filename ends with `.rpy`

## 1.13.0 - 2024-08-06

- Renpy Launch and Sync RPE files in the game directory will now be excluded
  from the build using `build.classify` (Thanks to @brunoais for figuring out
  how to do this)

## 1.12.0 - 2024-08-05

- The option `renpyWarp.followCursorExecInterval` has been removed. The
  operation is now instantaneous.
- Removes dependency on the deprecated `LuqueDaniel.languague-renpy` and
  refactor features that depended on it.

## 1.11.0 - 2024-07-28

- A less intrusive notification will now be shown when a warp occurs in an
  open window
- Now relies on a random number to identify the process calling back to the
  extension than using a pid. This is necessary in case renpy was not opened
  through forking (E.g. editor in flatpak) by @brunoais
- Split different process outputs into different output channels

## 1.10.0 - 2024-07-24

- The RPE now dynamically imports the `websockets` module to avoid errors in
  web (https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/issues/26)
- The service will now only start if `config.developer` is set to `True`

## 1.9.0 - 2024-07-23

- The RPE would be installed every time a process was launched, even if it was
  already installed because of an oversight in the expression that captures
  the version.

## 1.8.13~14 - 2024-07-23

- Now also published on the Open VSX registry

## 1.8.12 - 2024-07-22

- Reverts CI/CD pipeline changes

## 1.8.1~11 - 2024-07-22

- Trying to fix the CI/CD pipeline but was unsuccessful

## 1.8.0 - 2024-07-22

- Remove notifications for warping in open window
- Adds a 'Show' button when .rpe is installed manually
- Append a hash to the .rpe file so that the file only updates when the
  contents change
- Fix some inaccuracies with settings documentation
- Enable auto reloading of the game when a game file first is saved with the
  setting `renpyWarp.setAutoReloadOnSave` enabled.
- ~~This extension is now also published on the Open VSX registry~~

## 1.7.2 - 2024-07-15

- Fix a bug where follow cursor would be enabled when a process was closed

## 1.7.1 - 2024-07-15

- Handles cancelation state more gracefully

## 1.7.0 - 2024-07-15

- Now supports sync features multiple Ren'Py instances, only affecting the
  process that was most recently opened

## 1.6.0 - 2024-07-14

- `renpyWarp.renpyExtensionsEnabled` is now a tri-state setting, with the
  default being `Unset`. The user will be prompted to set this setting when
  launching a game for the first time.
- Use a quick pick for the extension selection

## 1.5.0 - 2024-07-13

- Pin a supported version of `glob`
- Refactor of data plumbing. Less dependencies on classes and less duplicate
  calls. Things should overall be a bit faster.

## 1.4.1 - 2024-07-11

- Fixes a few bugs that broke the extension on Windows. Sorry about that!

## 1.4.0 - 2024-07-11

- Improve first time setup experience by prompting the user to set the Ren'Py
  SDK path and direct to additional settings
- Install the .rpe.py file in the SDK root on version 8.3.0 and above

## 1.3.0 - 2024-07-09

- Migrate source code to TypeScript
- Don't link to specific settings (it doesn't work very well)
- You can no longer start the extension with `renpyWarp.toggleFollowCursor`
- Say what process an output line was from
- Redo the notifications. They're cancellable now!
- Warp to file is now the title action, as this seems to be what people expect
- Many bugs were found and fixed along the way, but I'm not sure if they're
  worth mentioning.
- Overhaul socket handling. Now supports many Visual Studio Code workspaces!
  As a result of this, the setting `renpy.webSocketsPort` was replaced with
  `renpy.socketPorts`, which is an array of ports to try to connect to. The
  first one that works will be used.

## 1.2.0 - 2024-07-06

- Leave the websocket server running for a bit if connection is lost, like on
  a reload or a crash
- Close old socket if the same process tries to connect more than once

## 1.1.1~4 - 2024-07-06

Testing some CI stuff, no actual code changes

## 1.1.0 - 2024-07-05

- Don't attempt to modify .gitignore as we can't know what the user wants
- Add `renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp` back.

## 1.0.1 - 2024-07-05

- Fix a bug where extension would not initialize properly on Windows. As a
  side effect, the `renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp` setting is removed for now,
  as the dependency for it has environment specific bindings that I won't have
  time to fix for a while.
- Match pid to child process, as Windows Ren'Py creates a subprocesses that
  doesn't match what was expected

## 1.0.0 - 2024-07-04

This release is a major overhaul of the extension internally, signifiying a 1.0
release. Yay!

- Implements a new protocol for communication between the extension and
  Ren'Py, which uses a WebSocket server in Ren'Py to communicate with the
  extension. The largest motivation for this change is that the `exec.py`
  feature was canned on grounds of being a footgun.
  - The new protocol supports a wider variety of Ren'Py versions. Let me know
    if you find a version that doesn't work!
  - Adds a new setting, `renpyWarp.websocketPort`, to control the port the
    websockets server should listen on.
  - A new setting, `renpyWarp.renpyExtensionsEnabled` has been added to
    control whether or not the extension should attempt to communicate with
    Ren'Py.
- Removes the 'Auto' strategy for `renpyWarp.strategy`, as it is no longer
  necessary with the new protocol. The new default is 'Update Window'.
- Launch scripts have been removed. Use a `.rpe` file in your project to get
  the same effect.

## 0.26.0 - 2024-07-01

- Implements a task queue for exec.py commands, which should prevent things
  from happening out of order
- Removes retries on sync script injection, as it's no longer necessary with
  the task queue

## 0.25.3 - 2024-07-01

- Adds retries on editor sync script injection. It should now be able to
  recover better.
- The sync script itself has a better check for duplicates, checking if the
  function exists in the list before adding it.
- Removes duplicate redundancy checks added in 0.25.1~2, as they are now
  obsolete

## 0.25.2 - 2024-06-30

- Fix somewhat erroneous behavior introduced in 0.26.1. Now instead relies on
  the previous warp spec to deduplicate a sync

## 0.25.1 - 2024-06-30

- Fix redundant editor sync on window reload

## 0.25.0 - 2024-06-30

- Improves the reliabilty of the _Follow Cursor_ feature by re-injecting the
  script when Ren'Py is reloaded
- Only conditionally inject the script if it's not already present, avoiding
  redundant injections
- The _Follow Cursor_ button now only appears if the feature is supported
- Adds a new setting, `renpyWarp.followCursorOnLaunch`, to control whether or
  not the cursor should follow by default
- Add OK button to notifications that did not have one

## 0.24.0 - 2024-06-20

- Overhaul of the _Follow Cursor_ feature, now can sync the cursor to the
  Ren'Py window. This is configurable via `renpyWarp.followCursorMode` and by
  default is set to "Ren'Py updates Visual Studio Code". The old behavior can
  be restored by setting it to "Visual Studio Code updates Ren'Py".

## 0.23.0 - 2024-06-16

- Bump packages
- Launches the game if not open when `renpyWarp.toggleFollowCursor` is
  activated

## 0.22.0 - 2024-06-12

- Fixes a bug where `renpyWarp.launchToFile` would always open a new window
  regardless of the setting of `renpyWarp.strategy`
- Clean up exec.py event handlers a bit more gracefully
- Increase timeout for exec.py to 5 seconds
- Don't attempt launch script if it's not supported, regardless of setting

## 0.21.0 - 2024-05-26

- Adds a setting `renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp` to control whether or not the
  Ren'Py window should be focused is focused when warping occurs

## 0.20.0 - 2024-05-22

- Raises the timeout for the `exec.py` feature test to 1 second

## 0.19.0 - 2024-05-22

- Adds post-launch scripts via `renpyWarp.launchScript`, allowing you to run
  Python scripts after launching the game (On Ren'Py 8.3.0+)

## 0.18.0 - 2024-05-21

- Now sniffs for the Ren'Py version with `renpy.sh` instead of `exec.py` to
  determine what features are available
- The progress bar has been made more accurate in Ren'Py versions >=8.3.0, by
  utilizing an optional check for `exec.py` script

## 0.17.0 - 2024-05-15

- Clean up the `exec.py` file if feature test fails

## 0.16.0 - 2024-05-11

- Tell users what Ren'Py version they need.
- `exec.py` writes are now atomic, as recommended by the Ren'Py documentation
- Waits 200ms for execution instead of 500ms

## 0.15.0 - 2024-05-03

- Log process output to a separate channel than extension output
- Change status bar text strings to be capitalized similar to other extensions
- Cursor follow now says "Following Cursor" instead of "Stop Following Cursor"

## 0.14.0 - 2024-04-20

- Handle errors more gracefully
- Instead of calculating a non-unique hash, use a timestamp to make the
  `exec.py` signature

## 0.13.0 - 2024-04-18

- Improve detection of consumed `exec.py` files by reading to and writing
  stdout
- Improved logging

## 0.12.0 - 2024-04-16

- No changes, just a version bump since the 0.11.0 was a pre-release

## 0.11.0 - 2024-04-16

- The extension is now called Ren'Py Launch and Sync
- `renpyWarp.strategy` has had its values updated for clarity. The new values
  are `Auto`, `New Window`, `Replace Window`, and `Update Window`.
  `Replace Window` is new, allowing you to choose whether or not to kill the
  process when a new command is issued.
- Test for `exec.py` support no longer cleans up the file it creates if it
  doesn't exist. Only Ren'Py should consume this file, otherwise the extension
  can confuse itself.
- Machine-specific settings like `renpyWarp.sdkPath` will no longer sync with
  VSCode's settings sync feature
- Stop using `chokidar` for watching files in favor of a more vanilla approach
- Numerous clarifications and improvements in documentation

## 0.10.2 - 2024-04-11

- Minor fixes to settings docs
- Fix an invalid link to a setting on an error message

## 0.10.1 - 2024-04-11

- Fix some edge cases with the cursor sync feature

## 0.10.0 - 2024-04-11

- Adds a feature to sync the cursor in script to the Ren'Py window

## 0.9.0 - 2024-04-10

- Implements Ren'Py's `exec.py` to dynamically warp into an already open
  process. `renpyWarp.strategy` controls whether or not this is enabled.
- Kills the process with a slightly harsher SIGKILL, which bypasses the "are
  you sure" dialog on games
- Improved process management across the board
- Adds `renpyWarp.killAll`, which will kill all running Ren'Py instances
- End the `renpyWarp.advancedProgressBars` experiment. The code burden was too
  high for this feature. It is perhaps better served via `exec.py` in the
  future.

## 0.8.1 - 2024-04-06

- Fixes a few small bugs relating to error handling, leading to the extension
  sometimes getting stuck in weird states

## 0.8.0 - 2024-04-04

- Improve handling for processes, which updates the status bar in real time.
  Once started, the status bar will change to reflect that, and you can also
  quit the game from this menu. This is powered by a new undocumented command,
  `launchOrQuit`, which is not meant to be called directly.
- To commands that aren't associated with the status bar, a notification will
  show until the process is launched
- Adds an experimental setting, `renpyWarp.advancedProgressBars` which will
  enhance notifications when Ren'Py is starting. It waits for your game to
  output something to stdout when it's considered "ready". Ren'Py does not do
  this by default, so this feature will be opt-in for now.
- Deletes the old extension icon from the repository

## 0.7.0 - 2024-03-29

- Add a button to reopen the game with the same parameters if it crashes
- Use `fsPath` instead of `path` when finding the project path (via
  [#1](https://github.com/furudean/vscode-renpy-warp/pull/1), thanks
  @SirFlobo!)

## 0.6.0 - 2024-03-28

- Status bar has 0 priority now, so it should show up at the end of the status
  bar.

## 0.5.0 - 2024-03-28

- Using commands will update the spinner in the status bar to indicate that
  the command is running. (Though it's slightly faked)

## 0.4.1 - 2024-03-27

- Minor documentation updates
